## Getting Started
Creating a Tier List
Add Items: Start by adding items to your tier list. You can either type in item names or use predefined lists, depending on your app's functionality.

Organize Items: Drag items into the designated tiers. You can rearrange them as needed.

Customize Tiers: Rename your tiers to reflect your categories. For example, "Favorite," "Good," "Okay," "Bad."

Save Your List: Click the save button to store your tier list. You can also generate a shareable link if this feature is available.

Load a Saved List: If you want to revisit or modify a previously saved tier list, use the load option.

Example
For example, to create a tier list of your favorite movies:

Add movie titles like "Inception," "The Matrix," and "Interstellar."
Drag them into tiers like "Best Movies," "Good Movies," and "Average Movies."
Rename your tiers as necessary and save your list.
